                Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
                <br>
                The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flue) with symtomps such as a cough, fever and in more
                severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding
                touching your face and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.
            </p>

                <h3>
                    How it spreads?
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Coronavirus disease spreads primarily through contact with an infected person when they cough or sneeze. It also spreads when a person touches a subject or object that has the virus on it, then touches their eyes, nose or mouth.
